# Developer Day 2021 Lab: Deploy a custom SPA app with Terraform
In this lab, you will leverage 3 Terraform configurations to deploy a Single Page App (SPA).
## Overview
Create and deploy your custom app in less time with fewer errors using sample code and Terraform automation provided by Okta. In 90 minutes or less, youâ€™ll learn how to do user mappings and assignments, and deploy your app into production. Easily tweak what you learn for your other apps.
